You keep the usual project subdirectories like /lib, /bin, /t, /doc and
so forth. CP adds just /dev to it, where all the action will take place.
The above mentioned directories will only contain the current release.

/dev itself will have 6 subfolder, for each cell type one. 
/dev/stage/ will of course have subfolder for every stage (/dev/stage/stage_name).
module and feature cells will be located in (/dev/module/cell_name/stage_name).
functional protos like: /dev/function/topic/cell_name. 

Every root directory of a cell has a status.cp.txt which reorts the
progress and inner dependencies of cell.
The root of every cell type except goal contains a index.cp.txt listing
the viable cells and their status.

A lot of what is usually hidden in branches, will in CP have its place
in the dir structure. This way it is search- and findable.

Under /dev/tool lies software to monitor state (which stages are there, which
are completed and so forth) and integrity of the project (do the module cells of
the current stage match the module structure in /dev/goal/lib) as well as a
global test runner.
